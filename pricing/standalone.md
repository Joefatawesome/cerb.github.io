# Frequently asked questions

## What are seats?

Seats determine the maximum number of workers who can use Cerb at the same time.

For example, a team of 30 workers who are evenly split into three, non-overlapping 8-hour shifts (morning, day, night) would only require 10 seats. That's the highest number of workers who would ever be logged in at the same time.

You aren't paying per worker account, so there isn't a penalty for inviting everyone to participate: full-time staff, part-time contributors, busy executives, interns, temps, contractors, partners, and volunteers.
