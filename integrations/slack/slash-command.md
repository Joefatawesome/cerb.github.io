# Create a simple Cerb bot using Slack Slash Commands

Slack makes it very easy to interact with third-party apps and services using their _slash commands_ feature.

To demonstrate this functionality, we'll add a new chat command named **/cerb** and instruct Slack to send those messages to a webhook[^webhook] in Cerb where we'll process them in real-time using a [Virtual Attendant](/docs/virtual-attendants) behavior.

## Enable the Webhooks plugin in Cerb

When a channel member uses our new **/cerb** command, Slack will deliver their message as an HTTP POST[^http-post] request to a URL we provide.

You could use any web-based technology to process these POST requests, interact with Cerb through the [API](/docs/api), and send a response back to Slack.

Since version 6.9 (Jan 2015), Cerb makes this process even simpler with the introduction of the [Webhooks](/docs/webhooks) plugin.  This plugin enables Cerb to catch webhook requests directly and route them to Virtual Attendant behaviors.  These browser-built behaviors can process a request, perform actions in Cerb or interact with third-party services, and then send an appropriate response.

As an administrator, you can verify that the Webhooks plugin is installed and enabled in your Cerb environment by navigating to **Setup** >> **Plugins** >> **Installed Plugins**.

Search for _"webhooks"_:

* If the plugin exists and is enabled, you're all set.

* If the plugin exists and is disabled, then click **Configure** and enable it.

* If the plugin doesn't exist, install it from the **Plugin Library** tab.

## Create the Virtual Attendant behavior in Cerb

Once the Webhooks plugin is enabled, you'll be able to create new Virtual Attendant behaviors on the **Webhook received** event.

First, let's create a new Virtual Attendant to keep things organized.

Navigate to **Search** >> **Virtual Attendant** and click the **(+)** icon in the blue bar to add a new record.

Enter the following details:

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/integrations/slack/slash-commands/create_va.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

(You can find a logo image at <https://brandfolder.com/slack>)

Click the **Save Changes** button.  Then click your new bot in the worklist to view its profile.

On the **Behaviors** tab, click the **Create Behavior** button.

Select the **Import** tab and paste the following behavior to import it:

{% gist cerb/d51a3b54eadf29df3286c02490486bf5 %}

You should now see the following:

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/integrations/slack/slash-commands/va_behavior.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

If so, we're ready to create the webhook that triggers this behavior.

## Create the new webhook in Cerb

Navigate to **Setup** >> **Configure** >> **Webhooks**.

Click the **(+)** icon in the blue bar of the worklist to create a new webhook.

Enter the following details:

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/integrations/slack/slash-commands/create_webhook.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

Click the **Save Changes** button.

A new webhook will be added to the worklist.  You can copy the **URL** to your clipboard, since we'll be using it in the next step.

## Add the new command in Slack

Now that we have our webhook listener and Virtual Attendant behavior in place, we're ready to hook them up in Slack.

Visit the [Slack App Directory](https://slack.com/apps/build) and click the **Make a Custom Integration** button on the right.

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/integrations/slack/slash-commands/slack_custom_integration.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

Select **Slash Commands** from the menu.

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/integrations/slack/slash-commands/slack_slash_commands.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

Name the command **/cerb** and click the green **Add Slash Command Integration** button.

Scroll down to the **Integration Settings** section.

Paste your webhook URL from the previous step in the **URL** field.

Set the **Customize Name** to **Cerb**.

For **Customize Icon**, you can save the following image and upload it:

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/cerb_mascot.png" class="screenshot" style="width:250px;height:auto;">
</div>

If desired, you can add the **/cerb** command to the **Autocomplete help text** in Slack.

Finally, click the green **Save Integration** button at the bottom of the page.

## Test the new /cerb command in Slack

Join one of your Slack channels and try out the new **/cerb** command.

## Where to go from here

Your friendly new bot doesn't do much yet, but you have a great starting point with endless possibilities.

You could modify the behavior we created to do anything that Virtual Attendants are capable of (which is a lot): add events to calendars, create reminders, add tasks, report about Cerb metrics, trigger webhooks in other services, post to social media, etc.

You could create a custom fieldset on workers to store their Slack user name, and the Virtual Attendant can use that field to look up their worker record when they send messages.  The bot can then personalize its actions to use their calendar, their tasks, and so on.

You could use our [Wit.ai](/integrations/wit-ai) integration examples to support natural language in your Slack bot.  Wit.ai converts freeform text into _"intents"_.  For instance, instead of only supporting the _"hi"_ command, your bot could learn the various ways people _intend_ to **say_hello**: _hi, hello, what's up?, how are you?, hola, allo, yo, hey, etc_.
