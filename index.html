			<h1>Build your own solutions with Cerb</h1>
			
			<p style="text-align:left;padding:10px;">
			We've invested the past 16 years working with thousands of teams in nearly every industry to build <b>Cerb</b> -- a web-based, extensible platform for collaboration, communication, and automation.
			</p>
			
			<p style="text-align:left;padding:10px;">
			Cerb provides a set of building blocks -- like records, workspaces, dashboards, and bots -- that can be infinitely combined to meet new business needs. 
			</p>
			
			<p style="text-align:left;padding:10px;">
			Non-programmers can improve their own productivity by building workflows and automations entirely within their web browser. 
			These workflows can then be shared within the community.
			</p>
			
			<p style="text-align:left;padding:10px;">
			Cerb is 100% commercial open-source. Programmers can rapidly add new capabilities using extension points. Data in Cerb can be integrated with other apps and services using our comprehensive API, webhooks, and scriptable bot behaviors.
			</p>
			
			<p style="text-align:left;padding:10px;">
			Many teams use Cerb to streamline customer support or automate sales. 
			Some use it to manage a project within a larger organization. 
			Others use Cerb to run their entire company.
