		<h1><b>Build your own solutions with Cerb</b></h1>
	
		<p>
		We've invested the past 16 years working with thousands of teams in nearly every industry to build <b>Cerb</b> -- an extensible, web-based platform for collaboration, communication, and automation.
		</p>
	
		<p>
		Cerb provides a set of <a href="/resources/guides/">building blocks</a> -- like records, workspaces, dashboards, and bots -- that can be combined in creative ways to meet new business needs. 
		</p>
	
		<p>
		Non-programmers can improve their own productivity by building workflows and automations entirely within their web browser. 
		<a href="/resources/packages/">Pre-built workflows</a> can be shared within the community.
		</p>
	
		<p>
		Cerb is 100% commercial open-source. 
		Programmers can rapidly add new capabilities using extension points. 
		Data in Cerb can be integrated with other apps and services using our <a href="/docs/api/">comprehensive API</a>, <a href="/guides/webhooks/configure/">webhooks</a>, and <a href="/docs/bots/">scriptable bot behaviors</a>.
		</p>
	
		<p>
		Many teams use Cerb to streamline customer support or automate sales. 
		Some use it to manage a project within a larger organization. 
		Others use Cerb to run their entire company.
