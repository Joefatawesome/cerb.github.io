## Introduction

This plugin enables Cerb to catch webhook requests and route them to Virtual Attendant behaviors.  These browser-built behaviors can process a request, perform actions in Cerb or interact with third-party services, and then send an appropriate response.

## Installation

As an administrator, you can verify that the Webhooks plugin is installed and enabled in your Cerb environment by navigating to **Setup &raquo; Plugins &raquo; Installed Plugins**.

Search for _"webhooks"_:

* If the plugin exists and is enabled, you're all set.

* If the plugin exists and is disabled, then click **Configure** and enable it.

* If the plugin doesn't exist, install it from the **Plugin Library** tab.
