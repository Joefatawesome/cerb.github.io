# Introduction

In this guide we'll walk through the process of linking Cerb to LDAP for authenticating worker logins.

# Install the LDAP plugin

First, you need to install and enable the LDAP plugin in Cerb.

1. Navigate to **Setup >> Plugins >> Installed Plugins**

1. Search for: `ldap`

1. Find the **LDAP Integration** plugin in the worklist and click its **Configure** button.  If the plugin isn't installed, you can download it from the [plugin library](/docs/plugins#library).

1. In the **Status:** field, select _Enabled_.

1. Click the **Save Changes** button.

# Add a connected account in Cerb

Now we can create connected accounts to securely store LDAP credentials in Cerb.

1. Navigate to **Search >> Connected Accounts**.

1. Click the **(+)** icon above the worklist to add a new account.

1. Click on **LDAP**.

1. Enter your LDAP **Host** and **Port** as provided by your LDAP administrator.

1. Enter your LDAP **Bind DN** and **Bind Password**.

1. Enter the following details:
- **Name:** LDAP
- **Owner:** Cerb

    <div class="cerb-screenshot">

    </div>

1. Click the **Save Changes** button.

If everything was configured properly, you'll see the new connected account in your worklist.

# Configure LDAP worker authentication settings

1. Navigate to **Setup >> Services >> LDAP**.

1. Click the chooser to pick the **Connected Account** you setup in the previous section.

1. Enter the **Search Context** as provided by your LDAP administrator.

1. Enter the LDAP attribute for email addresses (usually `mail`, but consult your LDAP admin to be sure).

1. Click the **Save Changes** button.

# Add / Configure workers for LDAP authentication

1. Navigate to **Search >> Workers**.

1. Click the **(+)** icon above the worklist to add a new worker.

1. Enter the **First Name** and **Email** of the worker at minimum.

1. In the **Login** section, pick **LDAP** in the **Authentication** dropdown.

1. Click the **Save Changes** button.

# Logging in as an LDAP user

On the login page, users will login as before, but will be prompted to enter their LDAP password.

  <div class="cerb-screenshot">

  </div>

If workers's ask what the password they were emailed by Cerb is, that is in case the LDAP server is offline.
