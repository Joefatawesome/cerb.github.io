# Introduction

The most popular [community portal](/docs/portals/) is the **Support Center**. This provides a place for customers to read recent announcements, search your knowledgebase, fill out contact forms, edit their profile, and review their [ticket](/docs/tickets/) history.

# Deploy the Support Center

### Cerb Cloud

### Nginx (recommended)

See: [Host community portals using Nginx](/guides/portals/nginx-proxy/)

### Cerb's PHP proxy script

Select the **Installation** tab.

You can deploy the `index.php` file in the web path of any web server capable of running PHP scripts (Nginx, Apache, IIS, etc).
