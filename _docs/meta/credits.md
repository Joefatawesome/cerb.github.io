# Platform

- **Devblocks** is a software development framework created by Webgroup Media that has evolved in parallel with Cerb. It provides the application framework, development platform, plugin architecture, and software development philosophy for all Cerb functionality and third-party plugins.

- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and current version of the HTML standard.
	- Cerb's interface is rendered via HTML5 markup.

- [PHP](http://www.php.net/) is a widely-used programming language for web development.
	- We use PHP for the majority of the application logic in Cerb and Devblocks.

- [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) is the world's most popular open source database.
	- We use MySQL to store and query all relational data.

# Infrastructure

- Amazon Web Services
- GitHub

# Libraries

- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) is a fast and concise JavaScript library that simplifies HTML document traversal, event handling, animation, and asynchronous interactions (Ajax).
	- We use jQuery for all of the client-side functionality in Cerb.

- [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/) is a curated set of user interface interactions, effects, widgets, and themes built on top of the jQuery JavaScript Library.
	- We use jQuery UI for the majority of the interface components: tabs, dialogs, autocomplete, drag and drop sorting, effects, etc.

- [Smarty](http://www.smarty.net/) is a template engine for PHP, facilitating the separation of presentation (HTML/CSS) from application logic.
	- We use Smarty to render the majority of the interface HTML and Javascript.

- [Swift Mailer](http://swiftmailer.org/) is a component-based library for sending email from PHP applications.
	- We use Swift Mailer to compose MIME messages and send all outgoing mail.

- [Twig](http://www.twig-project.org/) is an open source template engine for the PHP programming language by Fabien Potencier. It focuses on being fast, secure, and flexible.
	- We use Twig for placeholder and scripting functionality in snippets and bot behaviors.

	-  We use Markdown for formatting in HTML messages and knowledgebase articles.

	- We use the Amazon S3 PHP Class to provide the option to use Amazon's S3 service as long-term storage for infrequently accessed but heavy content (e.g. message content and attachments).

- [jqPlot](http://www.jqplot.com/) is a plotting and charting plugin for the jQuery Javascript framework. jqPlot produces beautiful line, bar and pie charts with many features.
	- We use jqPlot to draw charts in the legacy reporting plugin.

	- We use qTip to show tooltips on several legacy reports.
