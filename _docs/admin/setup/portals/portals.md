Navigate to **Setup** >> **Portals** >> **Search**

This page displays the configured [community portals](/docs/portals/).

A **portal** is a public, community-focused interface to Cerb.  This allows you to share access to certain kinds of information.

For example, the Support Center portal adds self-help functionality to your website by allowing visitors to open tickets, search their support history, and browse knowledgebase articles.

[Plugins](/docs/plugins/) can add new types of community portals.
