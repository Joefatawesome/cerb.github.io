### Remote Administration

This section configures the _whitelist_ of IPs that are able to access the `/debug` and `/cron` pages without a session.

### Session Expiration

This section determines the lifespan of [session](/docs/setup/sessions/) cookies.  When a session expires, a worker will need to log in again from that particular device.
