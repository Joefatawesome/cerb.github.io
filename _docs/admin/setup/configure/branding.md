Navigate to **Setup** >> **Configure** >> **Branding**

<div class="cerb-screenshot">

</div>

You can add your own logo to the top left.

In the **Logo URL** field, enter a link to an image of your logo.  For example: `http://example.com/logo.png`

You can also use the **Favicon URL** from your organization's website.  This is the icon that people see when they add links to their bookmarks.  For example: `http://example.com/favicon.ico`

The **Browser Title** is the label you see on browser tabs and saved bookmarks by default.

When finished, click the **Save Changes** button.
