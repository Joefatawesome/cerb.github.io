The [worklists](/docs/worklists/) for [snippets](/docs/snippets/) are typically limited to the records visible by the current worker based on their roles, group membership, etc.  Workers cannot view each other's private snippets.

This worklist allows administrators to view and manage all snippets regardless of their owner.
