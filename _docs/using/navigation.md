The global navigation controls are at the top of every page in Cerb.

## Logo

You can click on the logo in the top left from anywhere in Cerb to quickly return to your default page. This is a shortcut for clicking on the the first page in your navbar.

## Pages

The pages bar displays shortcuts to your favorite [workspace pages](/docs/workspaces).

You can use your mouse to drag workspace pages into a different order. The first item in your navbar is your default page -- it's where you'll go when you click on the logo in the top left.

You can add new pages by clicking on the down arrow at the end of the list.

## Worker Menu

Clicking on your name in the top right reveals the worker menu with actions specific to your account.

## Notifications

When you have unread notifications, a red alert box will appear in the top right. You can click on it to view them in a popup.

## Search

You can quickly view and filter records of any type from the search menu in the top right. Each search popup is a temporary [workspace](/docs/workspaces).
