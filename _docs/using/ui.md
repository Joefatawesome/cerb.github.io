## Tabs

On many pages, content is organized using tabs. Clicking on a tab displays the content for that section while hiding all other sections. The last active tab is automatically remembered; so if you leave a page and come back, everything will be the same as how you left it.

## Buttons

Many actions are represented as buttons which respond to taps and mouse clicks.

Some buttons are _split_ with a down arrow on the right side. Clicking on the left side of the button runs the default action, which is often described by the label. Clicking on the right side displays a menu for selecting an alternate action.

## Menus

Menus provide a list of related options.

## Worklists

Worklists are a filterable, pageable, sortable, and customizable set of records displayed using rows and columns.

## Popups

Popups provide additional functionality in a floating window. This allows you to accomplish many tasks without leaving the current screen.
