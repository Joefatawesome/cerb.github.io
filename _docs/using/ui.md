# Layout

The global navigation controls are at the top of every page in Cerb.

</div>

## Logo

From anywhere in Cerb, you can click on the logo in the top left to quickly return to your default page. This is a shortcut for clicking on the the first page in your navbar.

</div>

## Notifications

When you have unread notifications, an alert box will appear in the top right. You can click on it to view them.

## Worker menu

Clicking on your name in the top right reveals the worker menu, with actions specific to your account.

## Navbar

The navigation bar displays your preferred pages.

</div>

### Workspace pages

On the left side of the navbar are the workspace pages that you've added to your menu.

</div>

### Reordering pages

You can use your mouse to drag workspace pages into a different order. The first item in your navbar is your default page -- it's where you'll go when you click on the logo in the top left.

### Search

You can quickly view and filter records of any type from the search menu in the right of the navbar. Each search page is essentially a temporary workspace.

# Components

You'll see these common interface elements used everywhere in Cerb.

## Tabs

On many pages, content is organized using tabs. Clicking on a tab displays the content for that section while hiding all other sections. The last active tab is automatically remembered; so if you leave a page and come back, everything will be the same as how you left it.

## Buttons

Many actions are represented as buttons which respond to taps and mouse clicks.

### Dropdown buttons

Some buttons are _split_ with a down arrow on the right side. Clicking on the left side of the button runs the default action, which is often described by the label. Clicking on the right side displays a menu for selecting an alternate action.

## Popups

Popups provide additional functionality in a floating window. This allows you to accomplish many tasks without leaving the current screen.

## Worklists

Worklists are a filterable, pageable, sortable, and customizable set of records displayed using rows and columns.
