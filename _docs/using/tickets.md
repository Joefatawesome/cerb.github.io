A **ticket** is a specific conversational interaction between workers and contacts, including all of the related messages and other data. Every ticket is automatically assigned a unique reference ID (a non-sequential "**mask**") like `RYS-07092-910`. A contact can provide the first three letters of this reference ID for quick lookups.

The contacts involved in a conversation are referred to as **participants**.
