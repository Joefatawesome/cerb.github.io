[Group](/docs/groups/) managers organize common and highly related tasks into **buckets**.

Every group has an **"Inbox"** bucket to collect new, unsorted assignments. From there, tasks are manually or automatically sorted into the most appropriate bucket.

For instance:

* Billing:
  * **Invoices**
  * **Purchase orders**
  * **Receipts**

* Development:
  * **Feature requests**
  * **Bug reports**
  * **Troubleshooting**

* Sales:
  * **Leads**
  * **Prospects**
  * **Opportunities**

* Support:
  * **Inquiries**
  * **Documentation**
  * **Training**
