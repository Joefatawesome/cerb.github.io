[Workers](/docs/workers) with similar skills and responsibilities are organized into **groups**.

The workers assigned to a group are its **members**.

Groups typically reflect existing departments or teams (e.g. Sales, Support, Development, Billing, Corporate), but you are not limited to that approach. You can create groups based on anything.

Work can effortlessly be assigned to the most appropriate group as a whole, rather than figuring out which specific worker is both responsible for it and available to handle it.

For instance, an inquiry about buying one of your products can be assigned to the _Sales_ group, and a technical question can be assigned to the _Support_ group.  Then those groups can decide how to best handle their own assignments.

Access to resources like [bots](/docs/bots/), [snippets](/docs/snippets/), and [custom fieldsets](/docs/records/#fieldsets) may also be shared by the members of a group.

## Management

Groups are designed to be _autonomous_. **Managers** can perform actions like adding or removing members without requiring an administrator.

## Buckets

The units of work assigned to a group are organized into any number of **buckets**, which can be thought of like folders of related messages in a traditional email reader.

Every group has a default **inbox** bucket to collect new assignments.  From there, new work is manually or automatically sorted into the appropriate buckets.

Each member of a group may have a varying level of **responsibility** for each bucket. This allows the list of available work within the group to be prioritized in a personal way for each member; which makes finding the next thing to work on very easy for everyone.

## Access Control

Each group may be designated as **public** or **private**.  The content of a public group is visible to everyone, including non-members. The content of a private group is only visible to its members.
