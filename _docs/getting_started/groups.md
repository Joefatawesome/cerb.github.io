[Workers](/docs/workers) with similar skills and responsibilities are organized into **groups**.  Each worker in a group is a **member**.

This _abstraction_ provides many conveniences and efficiencies for collaboration.  Work can quickly and effortlessly be assigned to an appropriate group as a whole, without first having to figure out which specific worker is both responsible for it and available to handle it. An inquiry about buying one of your products can be assigned to the _Sales_ group, and an existing customer with a technical question could be assigned to the _Support_ group.

Groups are designed to be _autonomous_. One or more **managers** can oversee the group without requiring an administrator. Aside from work, group members may also collectively share access to resources like [bots](/docs/bots/), [snippets](/docs/snippets/), and [custom fieldsets](/docs/records/#fieldsets).

How members are assigned to a group is completely up to you, but groups generally map to existing departments or teams: Sales, Support, Development, Billing, Corporate, etc.

The units of work assigned to a group are organized into any number of **buckets**, which can be thought of like folders of related messages in a traditional email reader.  Every group has a default **inbox** bucket to collect new assignments.  From there, new work is manually or automatically sorted into the appropriate buckets.

Each member of a group may have a varying level of **responsibility** for each bucket. This allows the list of available work within the group to be prioritized in a personal way for each member; which makes finding the next thing to work on very easy for everyone.

Each group may be designated as **public** or **private**.  The content of a public group is visible to everyone, including non-members. The content of a private group is only visible to its members.

Lastly, you can assign a **profile image** to each group as a visual cue.
