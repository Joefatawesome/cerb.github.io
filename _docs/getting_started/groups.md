[Workers](/docs/workers) with similar skills and duties are organized into **groups**. The workers assigned to a group are its **members**.

Groups typically reflect existing departments -- support, sales, development, marketing, billing, legal, etc. 

However, groups may alternatively be based on any criteria that makes sense for your needs -- division, region, product line, and so on.

New tasks can effortlessly be assigned to the most appropriate group as a whole -- by anyone -- without first needing to figure out which specific worker is both responsible for a task and also currently available to handle it.

For instance:

* **Sales**: Inquiries about purchasing your products and services.

* **Support**: Technical questions.

* **Development**: Feature requests and defects.

* **Billing**: Questions about purchase orders and accounting standing.

One or more members of a group may be designated as a **manager** by an [administrator](/docs/roles/). Managers control the group's roster and assets, and determine how its tasks are organized and assigned.
