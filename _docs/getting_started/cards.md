A **card** summarizes a particular record in a popup window. This allows information to be retrieved and displayed quickly from anywhere in Cerb without leaving the current page.

Cards also provide shortcuts to common functionality for a given record.

For example, when viewing the card of a contact you'll see their ticket history broken down by status: all, open, waiting, and closed.  When viewing the card of a ticket, you can also open the cards of any participant or message on that ticket.

You can read the entire conversation on a ticket without leaving its card.
