The representatives who act on behalf of your organization are called **workers**.

These include full-time and part-time staff, interns, volunteers, managers, executives, investors, and partners.

Workers log in to Cerb using a web browser on various networked devices: desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. A single worker can be logged in from multiple devices at the same time.

This flexibility allows teams to collaborate from nearly anywhere; even when they're working remotely or otherwise distributed around the world.
