In Cerb, worker permissions are managed using **roles**.

A single worker can have multiple roles, and a particular privilege is granted if _any_ of their roles permit it.

By default, workers are granted all permissions. However, they still must be an administrator to enter [Setup](/docs/setup/) and perform global configuration.
