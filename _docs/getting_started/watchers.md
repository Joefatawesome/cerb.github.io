A **watcher** is a worker who wants to receive a notification about all new activity on a specific [record](/docs/records/). 

For example, a supervisor may be a watcher on all new tickets in a specific [group](/docs/groups/) to monitor the quality of the messages being sent to [customers](/docs/contacts/).

Most [worklists](/docs/workspaces/#worklists) provide watcher shortcuts in the first column.

A worker who is assigned as a record's **owner** is automatically treated as a watcher.
