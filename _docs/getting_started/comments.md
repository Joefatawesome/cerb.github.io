**Comments** can be added to records as a form of note-taking.

For instance, as progress is made on a task it can be documented with comments.  This allows workers to quickly share information.

Workers can also be addressed with an **@mention** to send them a notification about the comment. Any number of workers can be notified at the same time by including multiple mentions anywhere in the comment.

A record's [watchers](/docs/watchers/) will automatically receive a [notification](/docs/notifications/) when new comments are added.
