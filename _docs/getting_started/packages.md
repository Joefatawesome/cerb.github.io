**Packages** are a blueprint for importing a related set of pre-configured records into Cerb. A single package can contain workspaces, dashboards, bots, project boards, custom records, custom fieldsets, tasks, tickets, contacts, etc.

You'll find pre-built packages in the [Package Library](/resources/packages/).
