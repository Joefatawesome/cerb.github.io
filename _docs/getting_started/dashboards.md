# Dashboards

**Dashboards** extend [workspaces](/docs/workspaces/) by providing visual insight with highly customizable **widgets**.

### Calendars

Plot records on a calendar using date-based fields.

### Charts

Plot records on bar and line charts using quantitative fields.  Add multiple series to the same chart for comparisons between record sets or over historical time periods.

### Clocks

Display the current time in any timezone in either 12-hour or 24-hour format.

### Countdowns

Show the time remaining until a particular event with a countdown clock.

### Counters

Display an aggregated count, sum, average, min, or max using any quantitative field from a set of records. Display the result as a number, decimal, percentage, number of seconds, minutes, or bytes.

### Custom HTML

Display arbitrary HTML content and Javascript.  This is most often used to display widgets from other systems.

### Gauges

Gauges are similar to a counter, but they allow you to create multiple thresholds within a range.  For instance, the average response time of a group can be displayed as a gauge with thresholds for "excellent", "acceptable", and "unacceptable".

### Pie Charts

Segment arbitrary JSON data as a pie chart.

### Scatterplots

Cluster two-dimensional data using count, value, average, sum, min, or max using record fields from a worklist.

### Subtotals

Grab the subtotal counts against a field on any worklist and display them as a table or pie chart.

### Worklists

Display a compact version of any worklist.
