  tagline: Visual insight from highly customizable widgets
---

**Dashboards** provide visual insight with collections of highly customizable **widgets**.

Dashboards are **responsive** -- they automatically adapt to various screen sizes on different devices. If you have a narrow screen like a smartphone held vertically, you may only be able to display a single column of widgets. On a much larger desktop display, the same dashboard could display multiple horizontal columns of widgets.

Widgets can have different sizes relative to each other. For example, a large chart may be configured to display 2-4x as wide as the widgets adjacent to it when that much space is available.

By configuring the **layout** of a dashboard, different **zones** become available for widgets to use. For instance, two zones could be a left-hand sidebar and a larger content area to the right of it. Widgets determine their size based on the zone they are in. These zones will also collapse to a single column when a device's screen is too narrow.

## Chart: Time Series

Using a time series, you can develop a visual aid that evolves over time to keep your workers motivated by displaying a gradual approach of daily to yearly goals and everything in-between.

## Countdowns

## Counters

Count your open tickets or reports you still need to file. Keeping track of tasks that must be completed to meet the daily quota is made much easier with counters.

## Custom Dashboards

Design dashboards unique to your own user experience. Cerb allows a user to customize their dashboards to keep track of their auto-reply and email categorization bot behaviors.

</div>

## Gauges

Gauges are similar to a counter, but they allow you to create multiple thresholds within a range.  For instance, the average response time of a group can be displayed as a gauge with thresholds for "excellent", "acceptable", and "unacceptable".

## Knowledgebase Browsers

Knowledgebases illustrate how records, and custom records, like how an contact can link to emails 
and belong to an organization.

Have you ever lost track of all the tasks you need to work on or have completed already? Project boards are effective for even the most overwhelmed worker.

## Record Fields

As your integration with Cerb deepens, you may want to keep specific record fields on your dashboard to remind yourself how they work.
