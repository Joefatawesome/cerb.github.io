**Community portals** provide a way to publicly and securely share Cerb data with your customers and partners.  Each portal is a standalone website built on top of Cerb.

There are various types of community portal:

* [Support Center](/guides/portals/support-center/)
* Webhook Portal
* Conversational Bot Widget

You can also create and install new community portal types with [plugins](/docs/plugins/).

For instance, with the **Support Center** portal, customers can:

* Start new conversations from contact forms
* Edit their profile data
* Review their [ticket](/docs/tickets/) history
* Read recent announcements from your blog
* Search knowledgebase articles
* ...and more
