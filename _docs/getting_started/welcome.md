We've been working on Cerb for more than 15 years now, and we're eager to share our progress with you.  Even with such a long history, the project is still vibrantly active and [constantly evolving](/docs/history/) based on community feedback. Thousands of teams use Cerb to boost collaboration and automate workflows.

The next several pages will give you an overview of Cerb's most interesting features.

You don't need to have a copy of Cerb to follow along, but it wouldn't hurt to [sign up for a free Cerb Cloud trial](/cloud/try/) or [install Cerb on your server](/docs/installation/) first.

Thanks for your interest!  Let's get started.
