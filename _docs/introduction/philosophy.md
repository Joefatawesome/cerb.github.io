  tagline: Cerb is more than just code, it's a philosophy about software development.

## We believe in commercial open source

-  We've never felt entirely comfortable using tools that hide their source code, so we share __100%__ of ours on [GitHub](http://github.com/wgm/cerb).
- Our collaborative community shares thousands of critical eyes and minds, and shoddy work wouldn't make it past their constructive scrutiny. 
-  There will always be people who bypass the licensing, steal code, or copycat our innovative concepts. We're not going to be paranoid about it and mistrust everyone.
- If people have to be forced into financially supporting our work, then we went very wrong somewhere.  Our target audience wants us to succeed.

## We believe in agile development

-  We're not interested in holding back useful improvements just to have a more marketable announcement.
-  We aim to publish updates every few weeks based on community feedback.
-  We don't want to make hostages out of bug fixes and usability tweaks.  We won't charge you for them.
-  All of our development and [planning tools](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues) are open to the community.

## We believe in platforms and toolkits

-  There are hundreds of competing projects that are only interested in solving simple problems. We pick up where they left off.
-  We don't want to build schizophrenic software that forces everyone's conflicting opinions on each other.
-  We want you to see our work as a solid launch pad for the solution you've always wanted. We'll help you add the finishing touches.
-  People are used to asking what software wants them to do. We believe in taking the time to educate people on how to take control.
- It's rewarding to see people using our tools to solve problems that we never anticipated in creative ways that we never thought of.

## We believe software is art

-  Encyclopedia Britannica defines art as *"A visual object or experience consciously created through an expression of skill or imagination."*
-  We feel so many other projects think art means *"indulging fads with shiny interfaces"*.
-  Subtle beauty is important, but it looks like clown makeup when aesthetics try to conceal a lack of depth --  usability, flexibility, stability, scalability, and maintainability.
