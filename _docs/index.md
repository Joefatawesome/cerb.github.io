# What is Cerb?

__Cerb__ is a fast, flexible toolkit for web-based collaboration and workflow automation:

* High-volume __email management__ that scales to millions of conversations per year.

* Virtual Attendants for creating powerful, event-driven, __automated behaviors__ without any computer programming experience required.

* Custom __shared workspaces__ for augmenting team collaboration.

* __Dashboards__ for real-time reporting, monitoring, goal tracking, and operational intelligence.

* __Contact management__ for managing customer relationships.

* __Targeted broadcasting__ of personalized messages to thousands of contacts with segmentation and dynamic templates.

* __Notifications__ for keeping an entire team informed about new activity on watched records.

* __Task management__ for coordinating and prioritizing projects.

* __Knowledge management__ for distributing accumulated experience.

* __Mobile functionality__ for remaining productive while on the go.

* __Devblocks, a plugin-driven web development framework__, for rapidly implementing new functionality.

* A library of __browser-installable plugins__ for extending functionality and integrating with other applications and services (Facebook, Twitter, Twilio, Freshbooks, Amazon S3, JIRA, HipChat, etc).

* A __REST-based API__ for automation and integration with third-party applications and services.

* __Webhooks__ that trigger Virtual Attendant behaviors in response to external events (survey submitted, invoice paid, Slack /command, etc).

* __Portals__ for providing support resources and building communities around your brands.

* ... Time tracking, call logging, opportunity management, __and much more__.
