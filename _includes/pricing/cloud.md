# [Cerb Cloud](/pricing/cloud)

__Cerb Cloud__ is a subscription-based service that provides a finely tuned, ready-to-use instance of Cerb in an ideal environment. All you need to do is open a modern web browser, invite your team, and start putting Cerb's tools to work. We'll handle everything else.

Cerb Cloud is:

* __Fully managed__: We install Cerb and its dependencies in an ideal environment, apply updates and security patches, monitor and scale the infrastructure, optimize performance, maintain backups, interface with email service providers for deliverability, provide application support and other technical services, and more. You can focus on what you do best.

* __High performing__: Cerb is already designed to be fast and efficient. Cerb Cloud further accelerates performance by optimizing the underlying infrastructure and taking advantage of distributed services in the cloud. The database is continuously tuned for your workload. Resource requests (images, scripts, stylesheets, and fonts) are served instantly from a memory cache. Frequently accessed application data is retrieved from a memory-based cache cluster to reduce database latency. Background jobs are managed by an automatic scheduler.

* __Scalable__: Your Cerb environment can scale seamlessly from a single worker who sends a couple of messages per day, to hundreds of concurrent workers with a history spanning millions of conversations. Resources can seamlessly "scale up" and "scale out". New resources are automatically provisioned and added to load balancers in response to traffic needs (web servers, cache servers, incoming and outgoing mail servers, etc).

* __Secure__: All traffic between you and your Cerb instance is encrypted with SSL. We support "Perfect Forward Secrecy", which is a strategy that protects your past encrypted transmissions even if they are intercepted and recorded (even we can't decrypt them once your session ends). Our resources operate in a "private cloud" with private networks for traffic between components, and firewall rules in front of public components that expose a minimally necessary attack surface. Our own access to those resources requires RSA keys and two-factor authentication.

* __Highly available__: Failed components are automatically replaced, and redundant capacity allows your service to continue uninterrupted. The Enterprise tier provides a database cluster with near-instant automated failover, and the other tiers recover from database failures automatically within minutes.

* __Durable__: We archive a sequence of full daily database backups, as well as the incremental point-in-time changes in between. Long term object storage (like attachments) are redundantly stored in several geographically separate locations. We can also arrange for backups to be routinely transfered to you.
