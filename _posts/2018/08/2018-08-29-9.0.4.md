**Cerb (9.0.4)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** in development as of August 29, 2018. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** minor features and fixes from community feedback covering the [9.0](/releases/9.0/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Setup/Developers/Data Queries]** Added a 'Developers' menu to the Setup page with a 'Data Query Tester' option. This makes it much easier to test data queries and see their errors and raw output. [[#730](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/730)]

* **[Dashboards/Data Queries/Usability]** On dashboards, the 'Chart: Categories' and 'Chart: Time Series' widgets no longer expect users to configure the 'x-axis labels' and 'x-axis format' options. These are now automatically configured from the data query results. For instance, you can now change a `worklist.subtotals` data query from `created@month` to `created@year` without having to change any other properties.

* **[Profiles/Tickets/Permissions]** Fixed an issue on ticket profiles with the default 'Actions' widget in the right sidebar. It wasn't checking permissions properly for the 'Delete' and 'Merge' shortcuts.

* **[Records/Cards/Editors]** Fixed an issue on some record editor popups where typing `<ENTER>` in an input box could prematurely submit the form in the full browser window. [[#734](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/734)]

* **[Knowledgebase]** Fixed an issue in the knowledgebase where a category could have its parent set to one of its distant subcategories. This prevented the category tree from displaying. [[#736](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/736)]

* **[Profiles/Workers/Settings]** In worker settings, fixed an issue on the 'Availability' tab where the selected calendar didn't open its card when clicked. [[#740](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/740)]

* **[Profiles/Tickets/Permalinks/UX]** On ticket profiles, fixed an issue where permalinks to specific messages didn't expand them if they were collapsed. [[#725](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/725)]

* **[Time Tracking/UX]** Fixed an issue on the time tracking editor popup. Entering dates for the 'Log Date' field once again accepts date strings and provides a calendar popup. [[#729](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/729)]

* **[Records/Cards/Links]** Fixed an issue on cards in the 'Links' section. When a search popup opened from a links button, the subtotals on that worklist required scrolling the popup. It now properly overflows the popup window. [[#741](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/741)]
