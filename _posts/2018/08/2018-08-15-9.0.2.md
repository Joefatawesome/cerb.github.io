**Cerb (9.0.2)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** in development as of August 15, 2018. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** minor features and fixes from community feedback covering the [9.0](/releases/9.0/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Workspaces/Dashboards]** Fixed an issue with legacy widgets (e.g. Subtotals) where re-editing the widget could fail to restore the worklist settings.

* **[Workspaces/Dashboards/UX]** On dashboards, legacy 'Subtotals' widgets now show '(no data)' when there are no results. Previously this showed a blank widget, which looked like an error.

* **[Profiles/Widgets]** Fixed an issue on profiles with 'Record Fields' widgets where the 'Name' field of some record types wasn't set.

* **[Worklists/Broadcast]** Fixed an issue with worklist broadcast functionality. The `broadcast_email_` placeholders weren't being set properly.

* **[Platform/Updater]** Optimized the migration to 9.0 by not cleaning up old database tables with potentially millions of rows. In some enterprise environments this was adding an extra 10+ minutes to the process. These queries can be run by maintenance later.
