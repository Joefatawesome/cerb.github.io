**Cerb (9.0.1)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** in development as of August 7, 2018. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** minor features and fixes from community feedback covering the [9.0](/releases/9.0/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Pages]** Fixed an issue in the pages worklist where a worker being promoted/demoted to/from an administrator wasn't changing the scope of the worker-owned pages they were able to see.

* **[Worklists/Bulk/Performance]** On worklists, when using bulk update, if the "only checked" scope is used then the selected IDs are used to filter the list rather than any other existing worklist filters.

* **[Worklists/Bulk/Security]** On worklists, when using bulk update, each page of results now checks the current worker's permission to edit the given records. Previously, this was handled by checking the filters on the worklist, but these don't always restrict permissions. This also makes it easier to treat bulk update operations abstractly.

* **[Worklists/Search]** On worklists, filtering by a worker field (e.g. `owner:` on tickets, or `worker:` on messages) now allows the `me` keyword to match the current worker as a shortcut. Previously, this was running a fulltext search for 'me'.

* **[Profiles/Workers]** On worker profiles, the 'Impersonate' action is available to administrators from a new 'Actions' widget. If not an admin, this widget isn't visible.
