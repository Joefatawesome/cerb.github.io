**Cerb (8.3.9)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** in development as of June 7, 2018. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** minor features and fixes from community feedback covering the [8.3](/releases/8.3/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Performance/Log]** In activity worklists, the `entry:` filter has been removed. This could cause full-table scans with a major negative performance impact on larger sites. Such searches can be performed more efficiently using the meta info. E.g. rather than searching for a wildcard like _"you"_, which isn't even stored in the data, use `actor.worker:(id:123)`

* **[Bots/Custom Fields]** Fixed an issue with conditions in bot behaviors. Conditions from record-link custom fields weren't showing their options.
