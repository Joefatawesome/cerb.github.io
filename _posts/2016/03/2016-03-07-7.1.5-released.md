**Cerb (7.1.5)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** released on March 7, 2016; it contains **{{ page.release.count }}** features, fixes, and usability enhancements from community feedback covering the [7.1](/releases/7.1/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Support Center/Contact]** In Support Center portals, Contact Forms can now be configured to allow a 'Cc:' field which adds additional contacts to the ticket's participants list.

* **[Support Center/Security]** Fixed an issue in Support Center contact forms where a form could be submitted multiple times on the same session using the same CAPTCHA.

* **[CHD-4326] [Worklists/Tickets]** When using the 'c' shortcut to close a ticket from a worklist or profile page, an existing 'reopen at' date is no longer deleted.  This was causing issues when transitioning from 'waiting' to 'closed' where the reopen was still expected.

* **[CHD-4321] [Profiles/Ticket/Notes]** Fixed an issue on ticket profiles where sticky notes only displayed action buttons (permalink/delete) for the first note.

* **[Profiles/Ticket/Notes]** Fixed an issue on ticket profiles where the profile button of a newly added sticky note didn't work properly.

* **[CHD-4338] [Mail/Notes]** Fixed an issue when replying to a message and adding a sticky note at the same time. When the sticky note editor opened it was replacing the contents of the reply form. Sticky notes are now edited in a popup.
