**Cerb (7.2.1)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** released on August 15, 2016; it contains **{{ page.release.count }}** features, fixes, and usability enhancements from community feedback covering the [7.2](/releases/7.2/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Cards/Delete]** Fixed an issue with some card popups not refreshing their underlying worklist after deleting a record.

* **[CHD-4417] [Cards/Opportunities]** Implemented card popups for opportunity records.

* **[CHD-4344] [Setup/Workers/Usability]** Added quick search to the worklist on Setup->Workers.

* **[CHD-4420] [Setup/Cards]** In Setup->Configure->Cards, there's now a 'Save Changes' button, since the auto-save was confusing users and leading them to believe nothing was happening.

* **[CHD-4427] [Platform/Maint]** Completed bulk update batch records are now removed after 1 week during nightly maintenance.

* **[CHD-1801] [Worklists/Orgs/Bulk]** Multiple organization records may be deleted using bulk update.

* **[CHD-4275] [Worklists/Contacts/Bulk]** Multiple contact records may be deleted by admins using bulk update.

* **[Worklists/Tasks/Bulk/Usability]** When using bulk update on a task worklist, the desired actions are now selected with a checkbox before their options display. This simplifies the form and also allows for actions that don't have a 'blank' state (like a slider).

* **[CHD-4426] [Worklists/Tasks/Bulk]** When using bulk update on a task worklist, the 'importance' field can now be set.

* **[Worklists/Tickets/Bulk/Usability]** When using bulk update on a ticket worklist, the desired actions are now selected with a checkbox before their options display. This simplifies the form and also allows for actions that don't have a 'blank' state (like a slider).

* **[CHD-4426]** [Worklists/Tickets/Bulk] When using bulk update on a ticket worklist, the 'importance' field can now be set.

* **[Cards/Group/Bucket]** Fixed an issue on group and bucket cards where the ticket count buttons didn't filter their searches properly.
