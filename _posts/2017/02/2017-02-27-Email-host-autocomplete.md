When autocompleting an email address, you can start your search with an `@` to filter by the hostname first.

For instance, let's assume we want to email a contact named Jack Allen at Twinton University.  We don't remember if his email address starts with: `jallen@`, `jack.allen@`, `jackallen@`, `j.allen@`, etc.

We can just autocomplete starting at `@twin`:

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/tips/autocomplete-email-by-host/autocomplete.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

There he is, right at the top.

You can also autocomplete with the first letter of the mailbox at a specific host, like `j*@twin`:

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/tips/autocomplete-email-by-host/autocomplete-wildcard.png" class="screenshot">
</div>
