You've probably noticed that when you quick search a [worklist](/docs/workspaces/#worklists) it replaces the existing filters using the new query.  This is efficient and convenient when you want to change all of the filters at once.  Sometimes, however, you just want to add a few more filters and keep the existing ones.

To add new filters to a previously filtered worklist, start your quick search with `+`.

For instance, let's assume that you already have a [ticket](/docs/tickets/) worklist filtered by `status:o links.org:(Donter)` (open tickets linked to organizations matching _'Donter'_).  You want to further filter the results to only those updated in the past year, but you left the page and came back, and now the quick search field is empty.

You can use this quick search:

<pre>
<code class="language-text">
+updated:"-1 year"
</code>
</pre>

The worklist now has three filters:
