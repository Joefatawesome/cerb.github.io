**Cerb (7.3.1)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** in development as of February 8, 2017; it contains **{{ page.release.count}}** fixes and minor features from community feedback covering the [7.3](/releases/7.3/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Profiles/Comments]** Fixed an issue with the 'Comment' button on the 'Comments' tabs of some profile pages.

* **[Installer/Database]** Made 'InnoDB' the default MySQL storage engine in the installer.

* **[Installer/Database]** The installer will now verify that the MySQL version is 5.6+ when using the InnoDB engine (required for FULLTEXT indexes).

* **[Profiles/Tickets]** Fixed an overzealous 'Access denied' error on ticket profiles for non-manager group members.

* **[Choosers/Workers]** Fixed an issue with worker autocomplete suggestions.

* **[Storage/S3]** Fixed an issue with the S3 storage engine. The storage scheduler wasn't moving objects to S3 if the 'Host' setting wasn't explicitly set. This defaults properly now.

* **[Worklists/Broadcast/Domains]** Fixed an issue with broadcasts from bulk update on domain worklists.
