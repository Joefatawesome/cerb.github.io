**Cerb (8.0.6)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** in development as of August 16, 2017. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** fixes and minor features from community feedback covering the [8.0](/releases/8.0/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Setup/Import Packages]** Fixed an issue with **Setup >> Import Packages** where importing a bot behavior with an unknown event silently generated an error.

* **[Debug/Bots]** When exporting all bot behaviors from `/debug/export_bots`, the JSON output is now in the same format as packages. This makes it easier to export bots directly into packages.
