**Cerb (8.0.6)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** in development as of August 16, 2017. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** fixes and minor features from community feedback covering the [8.0](/releases/8.0/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Setup/Import Packages]** Fixed an issue with **Setup >> Import Packages** where importing a bot behavior with an unknown event silently generated an error.

* **[Debug/Bots]** When exporting all bot behaviors from `/debug/export_bots`, the JSON output is now in the same format as packages. This makes it easier to export bots directly into packages.

* **[Bots/Mail/Filtering]** In mail filtering bot behaviors, a new branch of 'Parent Ticket' placeholders is available if a new message is a reply to an existing ticket.

* **[Bots/Mail/Filtering]** In mail filtering bot behaviors, a **Message -> Headers** placeholder is now available. This is an array of the headers from the inbound message, with lowercase header names as keys. These values were always available, but hidden from the menu due to their dynamic nature.

* **[API/Attachments]** When uploading a file attachment in the API, the full record is returned in the response. Previously, only `file_id` was returned, which required a second lookup.
