**Cerb (8.0.5)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** in development as of August 3, 2017. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** fixes and minor features from community feedback covering the [8.0](/releases/8.0/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Mail/Compose]** Fixed an issue with the compose popup inheriting the 'From:' group and bucket from the worklist. This should now properly use the worker's preference when the worklist doesn't contain a single group or bucket filter.

* **[Attachments]** Fixed an issue with Firefox truncating attachment file names on a space.

* **[Worklists/Search]** Fixed an issue with negating deep searches in some situations. For instance, it wasn't possible to negate `messages:!(search text)` from ticket worklists.

* **[Debug/Status]** In the `/debug/status` report, added a `bot_events` section that subtotals behaviors by event.

* **[Debug/Status]** In the `/debug/status` report, added a count for `project_boards`.

* **[Debug/Status]** In the `/debug/status` report, added a count for `classifiers`.

* **[API/Addresses]** Fixed an issue with email addresses in the web API. When creating a new address or searching, the response was always _"Not implemented"_ even though the action was properly performed. Patch provided by [@kvdveer](https://github.com/kvdveer/).

* **[Platform/Developers]** Added a StyleCI configuration file for automated coding style analysis. Patch provided by [@nbeernink](https://github.com/nbeernink/).
