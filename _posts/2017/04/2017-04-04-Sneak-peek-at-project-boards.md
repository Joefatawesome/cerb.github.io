We've had a lot of requests for a better way to visually manage tasks by project. Here's a sneak peek at the new plugin for Kanban-style project boards in the upcoming Cerb 7.4 update.

You can add cards to the project based on any record type (e.g. tasks, calls, leads, issues). As you drag cards between columns, bot behaviors can automate the tedious grunt work for you (e.g. notifying people, setting custom fields, marking tasks completed). You can also completely customize how cards are displayed by project and record type.

This makes it much easier to move tasks (and other records) through the steps of a standard process. Check out the preview video and let us know what you think.
