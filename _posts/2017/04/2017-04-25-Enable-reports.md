You can use [dashboards](/docs/workspaces/#dashboards) to build your own reports.  Cerb also ships with several built-in reports that you can access from a workspace page.

Navigate to **Setup >> Plugins >> Installed Plugins**.

Search for: `reports`

If the Reports plugin is disabled, click the **Configure** button to enable it.

When the plugin is enabled, click on the last item in the [navigation bar](/docs/navigation/):

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/tips/enable-reports/navbar-add.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

Click on the **Help me create a page!** link:

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/tips/enable-reports/help-me.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

Select **Reports** and click the **Save Changes** button:

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/tips/enable-reports/wizard.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

You should now have a **Reports** page in your top navigation bar, that looks like:

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
