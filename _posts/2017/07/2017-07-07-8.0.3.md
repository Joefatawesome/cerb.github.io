**Cerb (8.0.3)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** in development as of July 6, 2017. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** fixes and minor features from community feedback covering the [8.0](/releases/8.0/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Platform/Windows]** Fixed an issue with Smarty in Windows. Filenames were being created with colons (`:`), which are valid in Linux/BSD but not Windows.

* **[Bots/Interactions]** Fixed an issue where changes to bot interactions from **Setup >> Import Package** weren't immediately visible. The cache wasn't being invalidated properly.

* **[Worklists/Contacts/Search]** On contact worklists, added a `lastLogin:` filter for searching for contacts based on the last time they logged into a community portal (or not).

* **[Profiles/Contacts]** On contact profile pages, added the `phone` and `mobile` fields to the record summary at the top.

* **[Files]** Fixed an issue where downloaded attachments could be renamed using URL escaping (e.g. spaces to `+`).

* **[Worklists/Search]** Fixed an issue with ticket worklists where an extra 'in groups of worker' filter was being added every time the worklist opened.

* **[Worklists/Tickets]** On ticket worklists, date-based columns (e.g. created/updated/closed/reopen) provide a `data-timestamp` attribute with a Unix-based timestamp. This simplifies many bot behaviors that modify the worklist.
