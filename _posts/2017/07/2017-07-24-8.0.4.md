**Cerb (8.0.4)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** in development as of July 17, 2017. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** fixes and minor features from community feedback covering the [8.0](/releases/8.0/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Bots/Messages]** In bots and snippets, added new message-based placeholders for `reply_to` and `reply_cc`.  These provide a list of "reply to all" recipients based on the headers of the target message. For instance, this simplifies an auto-responder bot that needs to send a confirmation to all parties and not just the original sender.

* **[Bots/Actions]** In bots, when using the 'Execute HTTP Request' action, new HTTP methods are available: `PATCH`, `HEAD`, and `OPTIONS`.  In particular, `PATCH` is used by some APIs (like Salesforce) to support "upserts".

* **[Profiles/UI]** Fixed an issue on ticket profiles when Cerb was embedded an in `IFRAME` from another site.  The `.visible()` jQuery plugin was throwing an error and interrupting other scripts.

* **[Bots/Actions]** In bots, when using the 'Send email' action, the `To:`/`Cc:`/`Bcc:` fields now save multiple line scripts as their value. Previously these were being saved as a single line.

* **[UI/Platform]** Added an explicit white background color to Cerb's stylesheet. For instance, this prevents a different background color from being inherited when embedded in an `IFRAME`.
