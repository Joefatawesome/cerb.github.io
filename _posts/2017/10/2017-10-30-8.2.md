# Important Release Notes
{:.no_toc}

* [**Always make a backup before upgrading!**](/docs/backups)

* **Cerb 8.2** requires **PHP 7.0+** and **MySQL 5.6+**.

* To upgrade your installation, [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading).

* The 8.2 update simplifies the configuration of sender addresses and signatures on groups and buckets. After upgrading, review your groups and buckets to verify that they have properly migrated to the new format.

# Custom Records

### Create new record types from the browser

New record types can be created from the UI without the need for plugins. Just like built-in record types, custom record types show up in the search menu, worklists, cards, links, custom fields, and itemized permissions in roles.

When creating new custom record types, a singular and plural label can be provided for use throughout the interface. 

The possible owners (e.g. app, role, group, and worker) can be configured per record type. A record with no owner types may be edited by anyone. When a record can only be owned by Cerb, it can only be modified by admins and their bots. Custom records owned by roles, groups, or workers are consistent with the behavior of built-in records.

**See:** [Create records for anything without using plugins](/blog/2017/09/08/Custom-records/)

For instance, an academic institution can create custom records for courses, instructors, rooms, and students.  These can be related through record link custom fields:

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/8.2/custom-records.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

You can then create a new records with all the same functionality as the built-in records -- autocomplete, choosers, cards, popup editors, worklists, profiles, custom fields, bot behaviors, etc:

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/8.2/custom-records-courses.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

### Use custom records in bot behaviors

* Implemented bot behaviors for custom record types.

* Custom records types are now available as targets in **Record changed** bot behaviors.

</div>

# Custom Fields

### First-class records for custom fields

Implemented cards, choosers, worklists, and profile pages for custom field records. This consolidates custom field management between setup, custom fieldsets, and custom records. It also provides more room for implementing custom field feature requests.  Custom fields can now be managed from the global search menu.

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/8.2/custom-fields-cards.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

### Deep search on record link custom fields

On worklists, record link custom fields are now included in the quick search menu.  Record links can be searched by ID using a chooser, or with a deep search that can filter by any of the fields of the linked records.

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/8.2/custom-record-link-deep-search.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

### Card popups for record link custom fields in worklists

On worklists, columns containing a record link custom field will now open a card popup when available rather than redirecting to a full profile page.

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/8.2/custom-record-link-popup.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

### Field count on custom fieldset cards

On custom fieldset cards, a search button shows the number of custom fields in the set. Clicking the button displays a worklist of the fields for quick configuration from anywhere.

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/8.2/custom-fieldset-count.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

# Reminders

### Reminder records with notification behaviors

Added reminders as a new record type. A reminder record has some text, a target worker, a future date, and a list of reminder behaviors to run at that date. These reminder behaviors can be highly reusable and offer public parameters for customization.

For instance, every worker can share the same 'Remind me by email' reminder behavior.

By creating a new 'Custom behavior on reminder', the possible reminder methods are nearly unlimited (text message, email, notification, webhook, proactive interaction, etc).

A single reminder can run any number of reminder behaviors at the same time.

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/8.2/reminders.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

Reminders can be quickly created from the 'Links' menu on any record's profile page or card popup. This also automatically links the reminder to the current record, and any number of additional links may also be manually added.

As records, bots can easily iterate, create, and modify reminders. Since each reminder has a single target worker, reminder behaviors can always use those placeholders (email address, mobile number, etc). Reminders have their own profile page, which means every reminder always has a permalink URL that can be used in bot behaviors when sending email or text messages.

A new `cron.reminders` scheduler job is responsible for running reminder behaviors at the proper time. It is automatically enabled and set to run every minute. 

In the past, reminders were implemented using more complex scheduled bot behaviors.

Unlike scheduled bot behaviors, reminders can be rescheduled or snoozed by simply editing them and changing their reminder date. The associated reminder behaviors will be reused and don't need to be created again.

### Create reminders from bots

Bot behaviors have a new 'Create reminder' action.

A global bot interaction can assist with creating reminders from any record or card:

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/8.2/reminder-interaction.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

A conversational bot behavior can confirm the details and create the reminder directly from the record:

</div>

# Mail

### Group-level mail defaults

Previously, an unnecessarily complex series of cascading defaults was used for mail settings: bucket, bucket reply-to, group inbox, group inbox reply-to, then default reply-to. This made it very difficult for people to understand where the defaults were coming from.

Outgoing mail defaults are now configured at the group level (i.e. send from, send as, HTML template, signature). When a bucket doesn't override these values, the group's values are used.  This is much easier for people to understand and configure directly on group or bucket records.

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/8.2/group-mail-defaults.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

### Simplified configuration of sender addresses

When configuring outgoing mail, the separate 'sender address' records are no longer needed. Email transports are now directly assigned to email address records to claim them as usable outgoing email addresses.

This simplifies configuration, and allows new outgoing addresses to be created directly from groups, buckets, and other configuration settings.

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/8.2/address-mail-transport.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

### Email signature records

Email signatures are now their own record type. This makes it much easier to share and manage multiple signatures.

Previously, email signatures were selected through complex cascading rules: bucket, bucket sender, group inbox, group inbox sender, default sender address.

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/8.2/records-signatures.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

### Configurable automated email templates

The automated email messages sent by Cerb for various events are now completely configurable (i.e. send from, send as, subject, and body). These include new worker invitations, worker new email confirmations, and worker account recovery. 

he previous templates included very little body text, which often led to them being flagged as spam. Including the worker and company names in the template can help improve this.

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/8.2/mail-automated-templates.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

# User Interface

### Improved usability on the global search menu

The global search menu now opens with three columns, rather than one potentially very long column that requires scrolling the entire page (especially with the introduction of custom records).

We renamed some record types so they're grouped together for quicker access (e.g. email mailboxes, email signatures, email transports).

In a near-future update, we intend to add frequently accessed record types to the top of the search menu, with a "more" link to expand the less common options.

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/8.2/search-menu-columns.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

### Confirmation when closing editors popups

When closing an editor popup with the `<ESC>` keyboard shortcut, a confirmation message is now displayed (i.e. _"Are you sure you want to close this editor without saving?"_). This allows workers to keep the editor open if closed unintentionally.

This is currently implemented for compose, comments, and bot behaviors.  It will soon be implemented for all editor popups.

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/8.2/editor-esc-confirmation.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

### Improved usability when resizing popups
	
Improved the usability of popup windows everywhere in Cerb. Previously, resizing or moving a popup broke its automatic height adjustment when its contents changed. The popup height is now recalculated after ever drag or resize event.

# Cards

### Added cards for more record types

Implemented cards, choosers, worklists, and custom fields for:

* **API credentials**

* **Email mailboxes**

* **HTML templates**

* **Knowledgebase articles**

* **Knowledgebase categories**

* **Mail transports**

* **Webhook listeners**

# Packages

### Import records and relationships

Packages can now create nearly any kind of record, along with complex relationships between records.

Previously, packages were limited to a few hard-coded record types (bots, custom fields, workspaces, etc).

This enables packages to configure and populate nearly any feature of Cerb.  We'll be demonstrating this with the upcoming comprehensive **Evaluation Package**.  It includes project boards, workspace dashboards, worklists, sample tickets, sample contacts, and much more.

# Setup

### Simplified incoming and outgoing mail configuration

On the **Setup** page, the **Mail** menu has been simplified to two **Incoming mail** and **Outgoing mail** sections. Each section is divided into tabs that are sequentially ordered (e.g. create transports, assign transports to sender addresses, assign sender addresses to buckets).

Previously there were a dozen options in the mail menu without any clear sequence to them.

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/8.2/setup-mail.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

### Added a Team shortcut menu

On the **Setup** page, a new **Team** menu is available for quickly setting up roles, groups, and workers.

It was possible to do this from the global search menu, but this wasn't intuitive for new users.

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/releases/8.2/setup-team.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

# Portals

### Cookie security

When setting cookies for community portal sessions, we now set the `secure` flag when SSL is in use. This helps pass PCI-DSS compliance checks.

# Installer

### Conversational bots, project boards, and webhooks are enabled by default

The installer now automatically enables the following plugins:

* **Conversational Bot Portal for Public Websites**
* **Project Boards**
* **Webhooks**

These important features will now "just work" without having to be installed and configured first.

### Default signature

The installer now creates a default signature and links it to the first sender address.

Previously, there wasn't a default signature, and it wasn't immediately obvious to new users how to create one.

# API

### Set complex records fields from the API

* When creating **activity log** records, the `params` field can be provided. This is a JSON-formatted key/value object.

* When creating **calendar** records, the `params` field can be provided. This is a JSON-formatted key/value object.

* When creating **contact** records, the `email` field can be provided. The value is an email address string that will be linked or created as `email_id`.

* When creating **group** records, the `image` field can be provided. This is a PNG image formatted as a base64-encoded string.

* When creating **message** records, the `content`, `headers`, and `sender` fields can be provided. The `content` field is a text string. The `headers` field is a text string of `Header: value` pairs separated by linefeeds. The `sender` field is an email address string that will be linked or created as `sender_id`.

* When creating **notification** records, the 'params' field can be provided. This is a JSON-formatted key/value object.

* When creating **snippet** records, the 'placeholders' field can be provided. This is a JSON-formatted key/value object.

* When creating **ticket** records, the `participants` and `status` fields can now be provided. The `participants` field is a comma-separated list of valid email addresses. The `status` field must be one of: `open`, `waiting`, `closed`, or `deleted`.

* When creating **worker** records, the `image` field can be provided. This is a PNG image formatted as a base64-encoded string.

* When creating **workspace list** records, the `params` field can be provided. This is a JSON-formatted key/value object.

* When creating **workspace widget** records, the `params` field can be provided. This is a JSON-formatted key/value object.

# Developers

### Custom placeholders in the template editor popup

The template editor popup is now capable of displaying custom placeholders along with those from a given record type. This reduces a lot of code redundancy.

Previously the template editor could only display one context worth of placeholders (e.g. workers for editing a signature template). This editor popup simplifies the UI by not embedding a full script editor with a placeholder menu for every field that needs one.

Clicking into the field opens the template editor in a new popup.

</div>

# Platform

### Moved some popular plugins to bundled features

These popular plugins are now bundled with Cerb as features:

* **Conversational Bot Portal for Public Websites**
* **Project Boards**
* **Webhooks**

Previously these plugins could be found in the Plugin Library, but it wasn't obvious to new users that they were available.
