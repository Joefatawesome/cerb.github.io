**Cerb (8.1.5)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** in development as of October 12, 2017. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** fixes and minor features from community feedback covering the [8.1](/releases/8.1/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Bots/Recurrent Behaviors]** In bots, added the following actions to recurrent behaviors: create comment, create notification, create task, create ticket, send email, and set links.

* **[Import Packages]** Fixed an issue with importing packages that used placeholders.

* **[Bots/Messages]** Fixed an issue on message-based bot behaviors where `ticket_group_` and `group_` placeholders were used interchangeably (even in picker menus), but only the latter worked.

* **[Bots/Interactions/Actions]** In conversational bot interactions with workers, added a new 'Prompt with date input' action. This normalizes date input and provides a popup calendar, similar to how date input works in the rest of Cerb. Once a date is entered and normalized, a 'send' button appears and is automatically focused. This allows a worker to enter a date line `Monday 9am Europe/London` and then make adjustments to the localized time before proceeding.

* **[Bots/Interactions]** Fixed an issue with bot profile images on the conversation popup window. Images weren't being updated and re-cached when the bot's updated date changed.

* **[Bots/Custom Fields]** In bots, fixed an issue with conditions that used multi-checkbox custom fields comparisons. These were sometimes failing on valid comparisons. [[#340](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/340)]

* **[Bots/Parser]** In bots, fixed an issue with setting custom fields on linked records from **Before new incoming message is accepted** events.
