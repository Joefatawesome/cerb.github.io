**Cerb (8.0.2)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** in development as of June 28, 2017. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** fixes and minor features from community feedback covering the [8.0](/releases/8.0/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Bots/Interactions]** On bot interactions, defaulted the color for 'Prompt with buttons' to the same blue as sent messages.

* **[Worklists/Tickets]** On ticket worklists, added `data-status` and `data-status-id` metadata to the `<tbody>` element to simplify bot scripting on worklists.

* **[Bots/Interactions/Profiles]** When using bot interactions on profiles, the `i` keyboard shortcut now focuses the interactions menu and allows keyboard navigation.

* **[Bots/Variables]** Fixed an issue with bot behavior variables. When setting a 'mixed records' list variable, the 'Limit to:' options didn't appear until the action was saved and reopened.

* **[Custom Fields]** Fixed an issue with picklist custom fields. Options with multibyte characters weren't being saved properly on selection.

* **[Workspaces/Pages]** Fixed an issue with importing workspace pages.

* **[Bots]** Fixed an issue with the 'Record commented on' event. Conditions that used the 'comment author' or 'comment record type' placeholders weren't matching properly.

* **[Bots/Mail]** Fixed an issue in 'Before message sent from worker' events. When setting the `To:`, `Cc:`, or `Bcc:` header as an action from a behavior, the message headers weren't always properly updated. These actions now use the `addTo()`, `addCc()`, and `addBcc()` methods in the SwiftMailer API.
