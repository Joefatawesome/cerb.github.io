We just added a new [how-to guide](/resources/guides/) for [Building a test environment with WebDriver automation](/guides/developers/run-webdriver-tests/).

Cerb provides a WebDriver test suite that automatically builds a clean test environment by remote controlling a web browser. This verifies that Cerb functions as expected and creates realistic sample data for testers, developers, and evaluators.
