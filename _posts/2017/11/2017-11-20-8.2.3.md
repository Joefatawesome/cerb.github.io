**Cerb (8.2.3)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** in development as of November 17, 2017. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** minor features and fixes from community feedback covering the [8.2](/releases/8.2/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Portals]** Fixed a cookie issue when Cerb is using SSL but a community portal isn't. The new `secure` flag being proxied on cookies was preventing them from being set.

* **[Mail/Relay]** Fixed an issue with relaying mail where the "spoof sender" option refused to send mail from non-local addresses.

* **[Bots/Portals/Interactions]** In bots, on 'Conversation with portal visitor' behaviors, added the following actions: Create ticket, create notification, create task, and create ticket.

* **[Bots/Portals/Interactions]** In bots, on 'Conversation with portal visitor' behaviors, added the 'Send email' action. [[#254](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/254)]

* **[Bots/Interactions]** In bots, on 'Conversation with worker' behaviors, added the 'Send email' action.

* **[API/Records/Activity Log]** Added an `activity_point` key to activity log record dictionaries.

* **[API/Usability]** In the API, the `show_meta` option now defaults to disabled rather than enabled.

* **[Bots/Interactions]** Fixed an issue with bot interactions that used the 'Switch Behavior' action in a conversational behavior. These didn't always pass public variable inputs to the new behavior.

* **[Bots/Behaviors/Import]** On bots, fixed an issue when importing a behavior fragment at the event-level. A PHP notice could prevent the import popup from closing properly.

* **[Bots/Interactions]** In bots, on 'Conversation with portal visitor' behaviors, added a 'Behavior has parent' placeholder. This is `true` when the behavior was called by another behavior, and `false` otherwise. This is useful when you want a conversation to return to a menu behavior, whether it was called from the menu or invoked directly.

* **[Bots/Behaviors]** Fixed an issue on bot behavior worklists where more than one behavior couldn't be opened at once because they shared the same card popup. Now any number of behaviors may be opened at the same time (for comparison, etc).

* **[Bots/Placeholders]** In bot behaviors, the `|json_encode` filter now works properly on dictionary objects.

* **[Bots/Records]** In bots, when using the 'Record Search' action, a blank result now properly overwrites a previous result that used the same placeholder.

* **[Bots/Records]** In bots, fixed an issue with 'Record Retrieve'. A blank record will now properly overwrite a previously loaded record that used the same placeholder.

* **[Bots/Records]** In bots, fixed an issue with 'Record Create'. If there was an error creating the record, the result will now properly overwrite a previous result that used the same placeholder name.

* **[Bots/Records]** In bots, fixed an issue with 'Record Update'. If there was an error updating the record, the result will now properly overwrite a previous result that used the same placeholder name.
