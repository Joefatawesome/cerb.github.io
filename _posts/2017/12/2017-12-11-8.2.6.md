**Cerb (8.2.6)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** in development as of December 8, 2017. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** minor features and fixes from community feedback covering the [8.2](/releases/8.2/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Mail/HTML]** Fixed an issue with sending HTML mail. When a mail template used HTML in the signature, this was being included in the plaintext part saved by Cerb. This is now down-converted to plaintext using the same method as the plaintext part we send. In the near future, this will be improved by using mail signature records in templates and allowing signatures to have plaintext and HTML variations.

* **[Bots/Behaviors]** In bots, fixed an issue with the 'Execute HTTP Request' action. If an HTTP response had duplicate headers, these were not being handled properly. They should be appended together and delimited with a comma. [[#555](https://github.com/jstanden/cerb/issues/555)] Thanks [@mrlilly](https://github.com/mrlilly)!

* **[Bots/Behaviors]** In bots, fixed an issue with the 'Execute HTTP Request' action. If a response contained invalid characters for the given charset (e.g. utf-8) then the body wasn't returned. We now attempt to correct encoding with `mb_convert_encoding()`.

* **[Bots/Interactions]** In bot interactions with workers, any messages with `cerb-search-trigger` or `cerb-bot-trigger` CSS classes are now automatically feature enhanced into a search popup or a bot interaction, respectively. This already occurred with `cerb-peek-trigger` and card popups.
