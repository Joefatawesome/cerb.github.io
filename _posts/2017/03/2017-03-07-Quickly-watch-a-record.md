Most [worklists](/docs/workspaces/#worklists) have a column of [watcher](/docs/records/#watchers) buttons where you can subscribe to a record and receive [notifications](/docs/notifications/) of new activity:

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/tips/quickly-watch-records/watchers.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

When you click on a watcher button you'll see a popup with a detailed status for each [group](/docs/groups/) member:

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/tips/quickly-watch-records/popup.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

This is great if you need to review the current watchers or add several new ones.

However, it adds several extra steps if you just want to add or remove yourself as a watcher.

You can hold the `<SHIFT>` key while clicking on a watcher button to instantly add or remove yourself without opening the popup.
