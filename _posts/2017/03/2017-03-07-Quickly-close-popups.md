Cerb allows you to get a lot done from a single page using popups. For instance, when viewing a [ticket](/docs/tickets/) [worklist](/docs/worklists/) you can open [cards](/docs/cards/) for each row to quickly review them:

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/tips/quickly-close-popups/popup.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

Instead of clicking on the tiny **(X)** icon in the top right to close the window, you can simply press the `<ESC>` key.

If you have several popups open and you want to close one of them, click anywhere on that popup and then press `<ESC>`.
