When you log into Cerb from Safari Mobile on an iPhone, you'll be given the option to switch to the mobile interface.

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/tips/save-cerb-mobile-iphone-shortcut/try-mobile.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

Tap the **Switch to mobile** button.

You can then save a shortcut to Cerb by tapping on the _Share_ icon in the middle of the bottom toolbar:

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/tips/save-cerb-mobile-iphone-shortcut/share.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

Tap the **Add to Home Screen** option:

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/tips/save-cerb-mobile-iphone-shortcut/add-to-home.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

Change the name to **Cerb** and tap the blue **Add** action in the top right.

You now have a Cerb app icon:

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/tips/save-cerb-mobile-iphone-shortcut/icon.png" class="screenshot">
</div>

<div class="cerb-box note"><p>
The first time you open Cerb using the new icon you'll need to log in again, since cookies aren't shared between Safari Mobile and website shortcuts.	
</p></div>
