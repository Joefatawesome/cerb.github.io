**Cerb (7.3.5)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** in development as of March 7, 2017. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** fixes and minor features from community feedback covering the [7.3](/releases/7.3/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Mail/HTML Templates]** Fixed an issue where HTML Templates were stripping the `ID` attribute from the message. This prevented a client from being able to include a table of contents above an auto-reply with responses in many languages.

* **[Bots/Behaviors]** When a bot behavior is marked 'private' it will no longer show up in the behavior list on profiles or in the bulk update popup. It will only be visible to other bots.

* **[Bots/Behaviors/Actions]** On bot behaviors, fixed an issue with the 'Send email' action. If the specified 'From:' sender address was deleted after the behavior was set up then sending the mail failed silently. Now the default sender address is used.
