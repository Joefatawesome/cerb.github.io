In [earlier versions](/docs/history/) of Cerb you had to create two [worklists](/docs/worklists/) to display your watched [tickets](/docs/tickets/) and your assignments.

Now you can display both on a single worklist with a simple quick search:

<pre>
<code class="language-json">
(owner.id:me OR watchers:me) status:o
</code>
</pre>

<div class="cerb-screenshot">
<img src="/assets/images/tips/owned-or-watched-by-me/owned-or-watched.png" class="screenshot">
</div>
