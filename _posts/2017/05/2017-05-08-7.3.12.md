**Cerb (7.3.12)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** in development as of May 11, 2017. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** fixes and minor features from community feedback covering the [7.3](/releases/7.3/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Worklists/Subtotals]** Fixed an issue with blank custom field subtotals on worklists.
 
* **[Reports]** The 'Worker History over Date Range' report can now be filtered by ticket status.

* **[Performance/Tickets/History]** On ticket profiles, when viewing the 'Participant History' tab, the 'Sender Domain' option now uses the `participant:(host:example.com)` deep search filter. This is much more efficient than the previous full table scan of the email addresses list.
