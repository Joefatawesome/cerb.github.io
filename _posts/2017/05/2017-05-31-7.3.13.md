**Cerb (7.3.13)** is a **{{ page.release.type }}** in development as of May 30, 2017. It includes **{{ page.release.count}}** fixes and minor features from community feedback covering the [7.3](/releases/7.3/) update.  You can [follow these instructions](/docs/upgrading/) to upgrade.

* **[Profiles/Group]** Fixed an issue on group profiles. The 'Members' tab always showed every worker.

* **[Profiles/Bots]** Fixed an issue on bot profiles. The count of custom fieldsets owned at the top was always zero.

* **[Worklists/Subtotals]** Fixed an issue that prevented some worklists from subtotaling by 'Owner'.
    
* **[Snippets/Worklists/Search]** On snippet worklists, added a `usableBy.worker:` filter. This replaces a static group memberships check that could become out of sync.

* **[API/Custom Fields]** Fixed an issue with custom fields in the REST API. Removing a value from a multi-checkbox custom field by prefixing it with `-` led to the addition of a new option on that field (e.g. `-Option1`), even though the value was properly removed from the target record.

* **[Bots/Worklists]** When bots modify a worklist, the bot and behavior displayed above the worklist now open their respective cards for quick editing.
